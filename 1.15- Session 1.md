## Reading Summary and Takeaways
**Summary**
	- 3 factors connecting language, reality, and power
		- **Language Structure:** The oldest view suggests power is located in the lexical and morphological structures of a language. This tradition, rooted in the work of Franz Boas, Sapir, and Whorf, posits that language entails a distinctive worldview. Notably, Philips points out that while this tradition recognizes language's role in creating reality, it has historically failed to explicitly represent this capacity as a form of power
		- **Face-to-Face Interaction (Discourse):** Emerging in the 1960s, this view locates power in the process of discourse between human actors. This category is further divided into three versions:
			- **The "Haves" vs. "Have-nots":** Power is seen as something individuals possess. Those in bureaucratic or professional roles (doctors, lawyers, teachers) exert power by controlling "turns at talk," thereby defining the social reality for others (patients, witnesses, students).
			- **Domination by Discourse:** Influenced by Michel Foucault and the concept of "entextualization," this view suggests that discourse itself holds power, dominating all individuals regardless of their status. Fixed texts are seen as particularly powerful because they ideologically reproduce ideas.
			- **Universal Agency:** This model views _all_ interactants as having the power to shape reality through the mere act of taking turns in conversation, allowing for a conceptualization of individual agency.
		- **Socio-Historical Processes:** The third locus involves large-scale processes like colonialism, nation-state emergence, and global political economies. In this framework, "language ideologies" (talk about talk) are used to manage populations and maintain state hegemony

**Key Takeaways**
	- **Integrated Understanding:** Philips' central thesis is that a complete anthropological understanding of language and power requires all three of these perspectives.
	- **The Power of the "Turn":** A recurring theme is the significance of "turns at talk". Whether viewed as a tool of professional dominance or a vehicle for individual agency, the control and execution of conversational turns are fundamental to defining social reality
	- **Language Ideologies as Tools of Control:** The article highlights how abstract power relations, such as those in a colonial context, are sustained through specific discourses and ideologies about language itself
	- **Dynamic Nature of Reality:** Social reality is not static; it is "continually emerging" through discourse and is "sustained and transformed through time" by the deployment of language structures.

| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Language Structure**                  | **Low/Implicit**              | Agency is constrained by the "lexical and morphological semantic structures" that dictate a group's worldview.                         |
| **Discourse (Haves vs. Have-nots)**     | **Asymmetric**                | Power/Agency is something some people have more of than others, such as doctors or lawyers defining reality for patients or witnesses. |
| **Discourse (Domination by Discourse)** | **Minimal**                   | Individual human agency is viewed as "relatively inconsequential" because all actors are dominated by the discourse itself.            |
| **Discourse (Universal Agency)**        | **High**                      | Every individual has the power to shape an "emerging reality" through the simple act of taking a turn at talk.                         |
| **Socio-Historical Processes**          | **Structural**                | Individual actions are the "process through which broader socio-historical power relations are sustained and transformed".             |
