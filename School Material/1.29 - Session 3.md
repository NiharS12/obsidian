## Reading Summary and Takeaways
### Key Takeaways
- **The Sign is Arbitrary:** A "sign" consists of two inseparable parts: the **signifier** (sound/image) and the **signified**(concept). There is no natural reason why the sound "dog" represents the animal; the connection is purely conventional.
- **Meaning through Difference:** Words define themselves by what they are _not_. "Friend" has meaning because it occupies a different semantic space than "acquaintance" or "partner."
- **Langue vs. Parole:** Saussure distinguishes between _Langue_ (the abstract, shared rules of a language system) and _Parole_ (individual acts of speech/writing). We can only study the system (_langue_) by observing individual use (_parole_).
- **Linguistic Relativity (Sapir-Whorf):** While the strong claim that language _determines_ thought (determinism) is largely rejected, the weak claim that language _influences_ habit and focus (relativism) is widely accepted. For example, if a language demands you specify "how" an object is shaped to count it, you will habitually pay more attention to object shape.
- **Ideology in Grammar:** Grammatical choices are never neutral. Using the passive voice ("The decision was made") removes the agent, whereas the active voice ("The CEO made the decision") assigns responsibility. This is known as **transitivity**, where the arrangement of Actor, Process, and Goal frames the narrative.
