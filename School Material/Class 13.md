Reading Notes:
# Health Intervention Research for Hispanic/Latino Communities

The provided articles explore public health interventions tailored specifically for Hispanic/Latino (H/L) communities, focusing on diabetes management and cancer control through community and faith-based organizations.

## Article 1: Delivering the Same Intervention to Hispanic/Latinos With Pre-diabetes and Diabetes

**Focus:** Exploring the feasibility of a joint community health worker (CHW)-led intervention for both individuals with diabetes and those at risk for diabetes.

### Summary

This longitudinal mixed-method study assessed the **Vida Vibrante** (Vibrante Life) program in Southern California. Traditional models separate individuals into different programs based on diagnosis—the National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP) for pre-diabetes and Diabetes Self-management Education and Support (DSMES) for diabetes—which can create barriers for low-income H/L families who rely on collective support. The study found that a "hybrid" approach—treating the whole family regardless of their specific place on the dysglycemic spectrum—is feasible, cost-effective, and culturally acceptable.
### Key Takeaway Points

- **Cultural Congruence:** Utilizing CHWs (promotores) and including family or friends significantly improved weight loss and retention.
- **Clinical Success:** Participants achieved an average weight loss of **3.29 lbs** (a large effect size of $d=0.77$).
- **Physician Influence:** Participants referred by a physician lost nearly twice as much weight (**5.19 lbs**) as those recruited from the community (**2.68 lbs**).
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** The program cost less than **$200 per participant**, compared to the $500–$800 range for national programs.
- **Barriers Identified:** Qualitative data highlighted barriers such as male gender (lower attendance), lack of safe neighborhood spaces for exercise, and financial constraints regarding healthy food.

### Table Information: Participant Characteristics (Table 3) 

|**Characteristic**|**NDM Group (No Diabetes)**|**DM Group (Diabetes)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Sample Size (n)**|18|15|
|**Avg. Age**|50.53 years|52.92 years|
|**Gender (Female)**|88.9%|86.7%|
|**Avg. Baseline A1C**|5.42%|6.94%|
|**Physician Referral**|11.1%|40%|

## Article 2: Dissemination of Evidence-Based Cancer Control Interventions Among Catholic Faith-Based Organizations

**Focus:** Testing organizational-level strategies to increase the capacity of Catholic faith-based organizations (FBOs) to implement evidence-based cancer control.
### Summary

The **CRUZA** randomized trial involved 31 Catholic parishes serving Latinos in Massachusetts. It compared a **Capacity Enhancement (CE)** intervention—offering technical assistance, workshops, and health committee building—against **Standard Dissemination (SD)**, which provided a toolkit and a one-time consultation. The study aimed to see if parishes could successfully adopt evidence-based strategies (EBS) to promote breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening.

### Key Takeaway Points

- **Feasibility of FBOs:** Catholic parishes are trusted "natural settings" for reaching underserved Latinos marginalized from the mainstream health system.    
- **Intervention Efficacy:** All participating parishes increased their cancer control activities. The CE group was significantly more likely to implement **small media** (90% vs 64% for SD).
- **Readiness:** Findings suggest parishes may already have the capacity to implement health programs if materials are culturally adapted and "packaged" for lay leaders.
- **Implementation Preference:** Parishes most frequently utilized small media (bookmarks, bulletin inserts) because they were less complex to implement than one-to-one education or reducing structural barriers.
### Table Information: CRUZA Evidence-Based Strategies (Table 1) 

|**EBS Type**|**Community Guide Definition**|**Sample Packaged Materials**|
|---|---|---|
|**Small Media**|Videos and printed materials (letters, brochures, newsletters)|Bible bookmarks, bulletin inserts, posters, tip sheets|
|**Group Education**|Lectures or interactive formats by professionals or laypeople|Guest speakers, CRC Bingo|
|**Client Reminders**|Written/telephone messages advising people they are due|Birthday cards with reminders, birthday bulletin inserts|
|**One-to-One Education**|Delivery of info by professionals or lay advisors in person/phone|Conversations after mass|
|**Reducing Barriers**|Addressing non-economic burdens (distance, time, language)|Transportation volunteers, childcare, community partnerships|
